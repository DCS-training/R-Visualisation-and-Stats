# R-Visualisation-and-Stats
Readme File 

Hello Everyone! This is the Readme File for the **Statistics and Visualisation with R** Class. 

This course is focusing on 2 aspects of using R for your research i.e. **visualising your data** and **compute some basic Statistics** on it. 

There is much more you can do with R and R Studio and there are a lot of video tutorials you can watch and posts you can read: 

- If you want to learn more on **Data Wrangling** with R: [https://www.linkedin.com/learning/data-wrangling-in-r/welcome?u=50251009 ](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/data-wrangling-in-r/welcome?u=50251009)[https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/03-dplyr.html ](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/03-dplyr.html)
- If you want to keep learn **small bits over a long period** of time this is a very interesting approach[ https://www.linkedin.com/learning/r-for-data-science- lunchbreak-lessons/exercise-files?u=50251009 ](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/r-for-data-science-lunchbreak-lessons/exercise-files?u=50251009)
- **Machine Learning** with R[ https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine- learning-in-r-step-by-step/ ](https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-r-step-by-step/)[https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/machine-learning-in-r ](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/machine-learning-in-r)
- If you want to learn more on using **R and GIS together**

More generally, the good thing of R being an Open Source software means you can find  a lot of help online. If at any point of your research you get stuck on something just google the issue and 99% of times someone else posted about it already! 

The best sites on where to **find info and help** are: 

- [https://stackoverflow.com/ ](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- [https://www.r-bloggers.com/ ](https://www.r-bloggers.com/)

What you are going to find in this repo

- In  the  ***installation  instructions***  you  can  find  the  installation instructions.  
- In the ***classes*** folder you can find all the codes covered during the course. 
- In  the  ***challenges***  folder  you  can  find a series of challenges with correspondent solutions that you can use to test what you have learnt. 
- In the ***datasets*** you are going to find all information concerning the datasets used in the classes and challenges. 


How to set a R project  

- We are going to cover the subject during the first class but you can find more info on how to set a project in here[ https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en- us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects ](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects)
- Or you can watch this video:[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJMWlDptYw ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyJMWlDptYw)
- For this class you would need 5 subfolders : 
- Data 
- Code 
- Challenges 
- Solution  
- Graphs
